tangerine - Perl dependency metadata tool
-----------------------------------------

This utility attempts to examine and analyze perl files, directories or
perl distribution archives, reporting provided modules, and compile-time
and run-time depencies.

In the *diff* mode it reports differences between two directories or
perl distribution archives.
