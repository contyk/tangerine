=head1 NAME

tangerine - Perl dependency metadata tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

tangerine [options] <files or directories>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility attempts to examine and analyze perl files, directories or
perl distribution archives, reporting provided modules, and compile-time
and run-time depencies.

In the B<diff> mode it reports differences between two directories or
perl distribution archives.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--all|-a>

Examine all recursively discovered files.  By default, only perl files
are considered.

=item B<--compact|-c>

Do not list dependencies provides by the examined set.

=item B<--diff|-d FOO BAR>

Examine I<FOO> and I<BAR> and report metadata differences, ignoring
line numbers.  These can be directories or distribution tarballs.

=item B<--files|-f>

Report findings per file instead of per module.  This option has no
effect with B<--compact>.

=item B<--jobs|-j NUM>

Defines the number of workers used for parallel processing.  By default,
the optimal number of workers is determined automatically.

=item B<--help|-h>

Display this help.

=item B<--mode|-m MODE>

Only look for this specific  metadata.  Valid options are I<compile>
(modules required at compile time), I<runtime> (modules required at
runtime), I<package> (modules provided) and I<all>.  For backwards
compatibility, I<p|prov>, I<r|req> and I<u|use> are also understood.
This option is automatically set to I<all> if B<--compact> is also
used.  Defaults to I<all>.

=item B<--verbose|-v>

Be a little more verbose where it makes sense.
